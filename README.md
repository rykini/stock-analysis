# stock-analysis

## Overview of Project
The project is to analyze on a number of different stocks in year 2017 and 2018. Two macros are created in VBA to output some intuitive information about the stocks. 

## Results
Below is the anaylsis our macro creates. There are twelve tickers. The 'Total Daily Volume' is a sum of volumes in each year. To get the 'Return' value, the ticker's ending price is divided by the ticker's starting price of the year, then substracted by 1. The colomn is color-coded, green means the ticker had a growth in the given year, whereas red indicates there was a loss.
